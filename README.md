## Introduction
My understanding of web scraping is patience and attention to details. Scraping is not rocket science (deep learning is). When I do scraping, I typically spend 50% of my time in analyzing the source (navigate through HTML parse tree or inspect element to find the post form) and the rest 50% in ETL. The most useful tools for me are requests, bs4 ,pandas and csv. Some people may recommend selenium for non-static website.
## Accomplishements
Successfully scraped product information, including titles, descriptions, pricing, and specifications, from the Flipkart website. Extracted and processed customer reviews, allowing sentiment analysis and identification of trends in customer feedback.
